The `Sources for Android SDK` package provides instant access to the documentation and source code of the `android.jar` classes in Android Studio.

Unfortunately, this package does not become available during the Developer Preview, which slows down debugging and development while test-driving the upcoming `compileSdkVersion`.

But in the meantime, this Github Actions workflow can build a package from a developing branch of the [SDK platform source repo](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base). This package can also be updated normally using the SDK updater when the official version becomes available.

You can enable Github [Release Watch](.images/watch-release.png) to get notified when a new build gets released on this repo.

## Usage

1. Download and extract the `android-32` folder from the package
2. Move the extracted folder into the [Android SDK Location's](.images/sdk-location.jpg) `/sources` directory.
3. Restart Android Studio.

## Build

1. Fork this repo on Github.
2. [Create a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Sources%20for%20Android%20SDK) with **_No expiration_**.
3. Go to the [Repo Actions Secrets](/../../settings/secrets/actions/new) and add the generated token named as `PAT`.
4. Now go to the [Actions Workflow](/../../actions/workflows/build-package.yml) and select `Run workflow` dropdown menu.
5. Set a *Platform Source Branch Name* from the [Google Android Source Repo](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base), *API Level* and *Version Name* (optional).
6. Run the workflow and wait for the package to appear on the [Releases](/../../releases).
